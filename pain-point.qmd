Studying data analysis gives a higher level understanding of what we can
generalize from specific analysis from experience and how we can pass it
down to students.

Pain points:

1.  **Coming up with a good question is way more difficult than solving
    the problem**

2.  **Who would be my audience? Where to give talks and publish?**

    It is a topic not discussed enough in the statistics community, but
    there are some discussions in the IEEE community in viz, in Fairness
    ML, in HCI.
